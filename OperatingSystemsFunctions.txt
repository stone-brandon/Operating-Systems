The Windows operating system is the main operating system used in the world with the usage being around 80-90 percent worldwide.
It's created by Microsoft.
Most widely supported OS for desktop gamers.
However it generally has poor security with a high probability with adware and malware. High instability.

The MacOS operating system is the main operating system used in Apple desktops. Not to be confused with iOS which is for mobile apple users.
It's created by Apple!
Probably the best operating system for content creation such as photography.
Easy to use if you know the Apple ecosystem. But will take time to learn if you're not familiar with Apple products.

Another operating system to talk about is the iOS by Apple. 
It's for mobile app users on the iPhone and such.
I've been using iOS since around 2009 and the iPhone is such a big part of my life. I'm fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem other than my music platform haha.
iOS is simple to use. The app store and ecosystem makes it so that it's hard for bugs and such to interfere with the operating system due to how closed off it is compared to Android.
